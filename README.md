** Fortune Teller **

- Fortune Teller is a game where you ask the Great Mystic some of your deepest, darkest questions. Out loud or to yourself, you can ask a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ question and get an answer that gives you insight and wisdom to your inquiry.

- From design to execution, coding for this game came to life throughout the learning process. Even though it is not a very complex game, implementing a list to randomly choose from and a while loop with “if” statements took a bit of work to get to flow harmoniously. When the original concept of the game was first conceived, I did not have a custom function worked into it. The function later got implemented into the project, which made the overall performance of the game that much better and the code more clean and organized.

- There’s a lot I learned from this project purely from the stance of it being the first coding game I’ve made in general and on my own and that alone is a milestone in my Python journey, however things that stand out that were some true “ah-ha!” moments were: getting a better grasp on while loops, when and where break statements in conditionals are best used, that you don’t have to use “elif” all the time, getting the random import to randomize properly, and not making the list one giant chunk and instead breaking it up neatly to read better. Writing beautiful code is just important as the code itself!
